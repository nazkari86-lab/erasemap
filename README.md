# EraseMap

EraseMap answers one concrete question: **after a biometric deletion request, which registered
copy or derivative can still be used?** It models the source record, Face ID template, search
index, cache, backup, model influence, and audit receipt as a typed lineage graph. The auditor
returns `COMPLETE`, `INCOMPLETE`, or `UNVERIFIED`, plus the shortest counterexample path and a
cost-aware remediation plan.

The project is intentionally system-neutral: the same graph contract can describe a school
access system, a bank KYC flow, or a government identity service. That portability is a research
hypothesis to test, not a claim of production validation.

EraseMap covers only artifacts registered by trusted instrumentation. It does not prove global
physical erasure, detect secret unregistered copies, provide legal advice, or claim validation on
eGov, Face ID, or another production identity system.

## Quick demonstration

```bash
erasemap audit examples/five_branch_system.json --subject subject-1
erasemap generate --seed 7 --nodes 100 --fault STALE_CACHE --output /tmp/case.json
erasemap benchmark dev --protocol benchmark/protocol-v1.json --output outputs/dev-v1
```

The fixed example contains an erased enrollment record with one still-active face template, so
the first command returns `INCOMPLETE` and the path `source -> template`. An incomplete audit is a
valid scientific result and therefore exits successfully.

See [docs/CORE_PROTOCOL.md](docs/CORE_PROTOCOL.md) for the frozen experiment, baselines, evidence
contracts, receipt boundary, and interpretation rules.

## Real-face experiment

The repository also contains a reproducible deletion experiment on 400 public Olivetti face
images and two actually trained identification heads: pixels → PCA → logistic regression, and a
frozen ImageNet ResNet-18 feature extractor → PCA → logistic regression. Exact retraining without
the requested identity is compared with the unsafe baseline of deleting its records while leaving
the deployed model unchanged.

```bash
python -m erasemap.real_experiment
TORCH_HOME=data/real/torch PYTHONPATH=src \
  python experiments/run_resnet18_face_unlearning.py
```

See [docs/REAL_FACE_EXPERIMENT.md](docs/REAL_FACE_EXPERIMENT.md) for measured results and strict
claim boundaries.
